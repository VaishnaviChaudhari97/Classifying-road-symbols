# Classifying-road-symbols
This repository contains code for classifying random road signals into its category

Road signal classification using OpenCV and Keras. The model was build using different layers to classify the road signals into its category. Image processing techniques were used. The image was normalized, grayscaled, smoothened and histogram normalization was implemented. To add variety to the dataset, image augmentation was performed. After the model was trained, it was tested by using a random road sign image from the web.
